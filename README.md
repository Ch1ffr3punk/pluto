pluto - A Tor Hidden Service SMTP Relay using ORB.
Tested with [Mini Mailer](https://github.com/Ch1ffr3punk/mmg) and [smtpdump](https://github.com/Ch1ffr3punk/smtpdump).

A README for how to use the ORB (Onion Reply Block) feature will be added soon.
An ORB must be created with minicrypt and contains the .onion email address.
Stay tuned!
